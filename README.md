Project for the course "Software Engineering": Specification, Analysis, Design and V&V of a Classroom Seat. 

The System allows students to book seats for University lectures in the Covid-19 period. Reservation System. 

In the folder the are two pdf documents that describe the project: in "Progetto_IngSof_De_Vena.pdf" you can find the specification, analysis and design part; in "Relazione_Progetto.pdf" you can find the V&V part, with graphs showing the results.

In the Prj folder there is the Modelica and Python code (I used OMPython), that has been used to simulate the system in the V&V stage (Verification and Validation).
